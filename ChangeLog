	* Widen "acceptable" selectors, there were hacks that used certain characters we weren't allowing,
	  we now skip such selectors and don't store them at all          
	* In the event a selector is given twice, merge back the properties instead of overwriting them
	* In the event a compound rule was given we break it into the component selectors
	* Add forgotten method for "get all selectors"
	* Empty selectors are no longer outputted during write operations
	* Updated module, created more sophisticated directory structured
	* Updated tests
	* Update documentation
